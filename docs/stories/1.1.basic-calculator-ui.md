# Story 1.1: Basic Calculator UI and Number Input

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,  
**I want** to see a calculator interface with a clear display and numeric keypad,  
**so that** I can input numbers and see what I'm typing before performing calculations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Numeric Keypad Layout**: The app displays a clear numeric keypad arranged in a 4x3 grid layout:
   - Row 1: buttons 1, 2, 3
   - Row 2: buttons 4, 5, 6  
   - Row 3: buttons 7, 8, 9
   - Row 4: button 0 (spanning center position)
2. **Single Display Area**: The app shows a single display area at the top that serves dual purposes:
   - Shows the current input expression as the user types (e.g., "123", "123+", "123+45")
   - Shows the calculation result after equals is pressed (replacing the expression)
3. **Real-time Input Updates**: The display updates immediately when any number button is tapped, appending the digit to the current expression shown in the display
4. **Default Display State**: When the app launches, the display shows "0" and is ready to accept the first number input
5. **Display Specifications**: 
   - Text alignment: right-aligned for mathematical convention
   - Font: monospace for consistent digit spacing
   - Maximum display length: 12 characters (including operators)
   - Overflow handling: prevent input beyond 12 characters

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
This story implements the foundation of the MVVM pattern as defined in the architecture documents. The key components are:

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md#Technology Stack]:
- Programming Language: Kotlin 
- UI Framework: Jetpack Compose (declarative UI approach)
- Architecture Pattern: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

**Component Structure** [Source: architecture/component-breakdown.md#Component Breakdown]:
- `MainActivity` (View): Single activity hosting main UI, observes CalculatorViewModel
- `CalculatorViewModel` (ViewModel): Manages calculator state including displayValue (single property for both input expression and results). Exposes onNumberClick() function
- `CalculatorModel` (Model): Contains core business logic for input processing and calculations
- `CalculatorDisplay` (View): Composable showing single unified display area (serves dual purpose for input and results)
- `CalculatorKeypad` (View): Composable containing numeric button grid in 4x3 layout

**Data Flow Pattern** [Source: architecture/data-flow.md#Data Flow]:
1. User taps button in CalculatorKeypad composable
2. Composable calls CalculatorViewModel function (e.g., viewModel.onNumberClick("5"))
3. ViewModel uses CalculatorModel to perform logic (adding number to expression)  
4. Model returns updated state to ViewModel
5. ViewModel updates state properties, UI automatically recomposes

**Example Implementation Pattern** [Source: architecture/example-flow-2-plus-2.md#Example Flow]:
From the "2 + 2" example: "User taps '2'. The ViewModel updates its internal state. The display shows '2'."

### Project Structure Notes
**Missing Documentation**: The following architecture documents referenced in core-config.yaml are not yet available:
- docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
- docs/architecture/tech-stack.md (different from technology-stack.md)  
- docs/architecture/source-tree.md
- docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md
- docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md

**Development Guidelines**: Until missing documents are available, follow these assumptions:
- Use standard Android project structure (app/src/main/java/com/package/)
- Follow Kotlin coding conventions and Android Architecture Components best practices
- Place ViewModels in viewmodels package, Models in models package, UI Composables in ui package
- Use dependency injection patterns where appropriate

### Data Models
**From Architecture** [Source: architecture/component-breakdown.md#Component Breakdown]:
- CalculatorViewModel properties: 
  - `displayValue` (String): Single property managing both input expression display and calculation results
  - `calculation history` (for future stories): List of past calculations
- Simple data structures for calculation history: `Calculation(expression: String, result: String)`

**Display Value States**:
- Input mode: Shows user input as they type (e.g., "123", "123+45")  
- Result mode: Shows calculation result (replaces expression after equals pressed)
- Default state: Shows "0" on app launch

### File Locations  
No specific guidance found in architecture docs - dev agent should follow standard Android/Kotlin project structure.

### Technical Constraints
No specific version requirements, performance considerations, or security rules found in architecture docs.

### Testing
**Testing Standards**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs - testing-strategy.md referenced in config but not available.
