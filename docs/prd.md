### **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

#### **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an Android calculator application. The goal of this MVP is to create a functional, reliable, and user-friendly tool for performing basic mathematical operations and viewing calculation history. This PRD will serve as the single source of truth for the development team, ensuring all features are clearly defined and understood before development begins.

#### **2. MVP Scope**

The MVP will be limited to the following core functionalities:
* **Basic Arithmetic:** The app must be able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* **Calculation History:** The app must store and display a history of the user's past calculations.
* **User Interface:** The app will feature a clean, intuitive, and easy-to-use interface.

#### **3. User Stories**

Here are the user stories that define the features of the MVP from the user's perspective:

* **As a user, I want to be able to add two numbers, so that I can quickly perform basic arithmetic.**
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The app displays a clear numeric keypad.
        * Pressing the "+" button performs an addition operation on the two numbers displayed.
        * The result is shown on the screen after pressing the "=" button.

* **As a user, I want to be able to subtract two numbers, so that I can quickly perform basic arithmetic.**
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The app displays a clear numeric keypad.
        * Pressing the "-" button performs a subtraction operation on the two numbers displayed.
        * The result is shown on the screen after pressing the "=" button.

* **As a user, I want to be able to multiply two numbers, so that I can quickly perform basic arithmetic.**
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The app displays a clear numeric keypad.
        * Pressing the "ร" button performs a multiplication operation on the two numbers displayed.
        * The result is shown on the screen after pressing the "=" button.

* **As a user, I want to be able to divide two numbers, so that I can quickly perform basic arithmetic.**
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The app displays a clear numeric keypad.
        * Pressing the "รท" button performs a division operation on the two numbers displayed.
        * The result is shown on the screen after pressing the "=" button.
        * If the user attempts to divide by zero, a clear error message must be displayed.

* **As a user, I want to view my past calculations, so that I don't have to re-enter them.**
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The app must save and display a history of the last 10 calculations.
        * The history view should be easily accessible from the main calculator screen.
        * Tapping on a history entry should populate the main display with that calculation for reuse.

#### **4. Technical Specifications**

* **Platform:** Android (version 7.0 and above).
* **Language:** Kotlin.
* **Development Environment:** Android Studio.
* **UI/UX:** The design will be simple, with large, clear buttons and a display that shows both the input and the result.

#### **5. Out of Scope for MVP**

* Scientific calculator functions (e.g., sin, cos, tan, log).
* Unit conversions.
* Graphing capabilities.
* Custom themes or skins.
* Cloud synchronization of history.
* Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC).
* Ad integration or in-app purchases.
